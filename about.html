								<p>B4A establishes a community space for those with disabilities or interested in disabilities to get advice, teach/learn about disability culture, and improve accessibility at OSU. I have been involved in the organization since Fall 2020 and on the leadership team since Fall 2021.</p>
								<p>One of our current large projects is making a map of what is and is not accessible on campus. We have collected data for this map by manually going around campus. Now, we are looking into ways to present this information.
								Our first versions of the map will be hosted on B4A's website. I am leading the team to revamp the website and set up the features needed to best present the map.</p>
