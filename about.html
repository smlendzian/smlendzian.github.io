								<p>B4A establishes a community space for those with disabilities or interested in disabilities to get advice, teach/learn about disability culture, and improve accessibility at OSU. I have been involved in the organization since Fall 2020 and on the leadership team since Fall 2021.</p>
								<p>For this organization, I have, alongside other members, worked with various leaders at OSU to help them better serve students with disabilities, helped organize presentations and events to teach students about disability-related topics and engage them with disability culture at OSU, worked on creating resources to help students and faculty with accessibility at Ohio State, and worked on much of the behind-the-scenes organization to coordinate the leadership team in our various projects.</p>
